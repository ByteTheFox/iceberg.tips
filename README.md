# Iceberg.tips

I wanted to see if I could create an application using primarily AI with the following tools:

- [bolt.new](https://bolt.new)
- [database.build](https://database.build)
- [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/)

The idea was to create a business tip practice reporting tool, that would allow users to find out which businesses are asking for tips and if their tip practices that are illegal or unethical.
